This codebook is based off the features_info.txt from the data download.

Activity
- There are 6 activities that subjects were required to do, divided into each of the following - walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting and standing.
    - "walking"
    - "walkingUpstairs"
    - "walkingDownstairs"
    - "sitting"
    - "standing"

Subjects
- There were 30 subjects in this experiment, each of them tagged with individual numbers from 1 to 30.

Variables
- This is a shortened list of variables looking at just the mean and standard deviation for each of the feature vectors (full list in features_info.txt). The full list of variables in this project are the following.
